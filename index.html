                                There is only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still
                                standing today and it is the Pyramid of Khufu at Giza, Egypt’s Great
                                Pyramid. His son, Khafre, and another pharaoh, Menkaure, are credited
                                with building the other two pyramids at Giza, but neither of them
                                is as large or impressive as Khufu’s Great Pyramid, completed around
                                2560 BC and originally standing 481 feet tall (455 feet today due to
                                the removal of its outer casing and capstone).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Khufu, also known to history by the Greek name of Cheops, was the
                                second pharaoh of the 4th dynasty of Ancient Egypt during the Old
                                Kingdom Period. The 4th dynasty is considered to have been the ‘golden
                                age’ of the Old Kingdom, largely because of the gigantic size and
                                quality of the pyramids built during this time. Beginning with the
                                pyramids the Khufu’s father, Sneferu, built at Dahshur, the 4th dynasty
                                pyramids were larger and more refined than any others built before or
                                after them.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                Archeologists consider the pyramids to be good indicators of the
                                economic and political stability of Egypt throughout the Old and
                                Middle Kingdoms. It took a lot of resources to finance a pyramid
                                and organize a labor force to construct it. The size and quality
                                of their construction at different times during the history of
                                Ancient Egypt suggest that their were more resources available to
                                dedicate to building during the 4th dynasty than at any other time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Khufu improved upon the innovations that his father introduced in
                                the construction of the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, located
                                south of Giza at Dahshur. Sneferu’s pyramids were large and they
                                are the first to display the characteristic smooth sides of the
                                Giza Pyramids, but the shape of the pyramid and the ideal side-angle
                                needed to complete a structurally sound pyramid were settled upon
                                by Khufu and his engineers. The sides of Khufu’s Great Pyramid
                                rise at an angle of 51.8 degrees from sides that are 756 feet at
                                the base.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It is now illegal to climb the pyramid, but you can go inside.
                                A separate ticket is required to enter each pyramid. Only 300
                                tickets are sold each day, 150 in the morning and another 150
                                in the afternoon, after 1pm. Tickets on sale at 8:00am & 1:00pm.
                                No photography is allowed inside the pyramid.

                                    One of the kings of the hyper car world in recent years
                                    has been the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It was already powerful
                                    as is, but Bugatti wanted more and created the Veyron 16.4
                                    Super Sport, smashing the world record for fastest 
                                    roduction vehicle (at the time).

                                To start, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport’s skin is 100
                                percent carbon-fiber, in an attempt to keep it as light as
                                possible. It also boasts a full carbon-fiber monocoque design
                                for a little added rigidity in the corners and extra strength
                                should you find yourself in a wreck.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The front fascia is disturbingly angled and looks as if it
                                would act almost like an airflow battering ram, but the
                                engineers managed to work in the chrome-outlined Bugatti
                                horseshoe grille and the side air intake vents in a way
                                that made efficient use of this flatter-than-usual front
                                end without adding excessive drag. At the base of the front
                                fascia sits a lower lip spoiler that yanks the front end
                                downward under high speed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In terms of colors, you have only a handful of choices.
                                The first color choice is Dark Blue Tinted, which is just
                                as its name alludes to: it is a solid royal blue that really
                                gives the Veyron a mysterious look. What’s more, down the
                                car’s shoulder, you get a thick line of silver that wraps
                                around the backside, giving it a sick contrast. The next
                                color option is dark blue tinted with carbon white silver.
                                The entire car is draped in the dark blue tint color from
                                before, but Bugatti will add in white silver to the doors,
                                the rear air intake, and the front fender. The next hue
                                option is white silver, which is essentially a pure white
                                with a slight tint of silver added to the mix. This color
                                isn’t as impressive as the others, but it certainly adds a
                                little more elegance to the body. The final color option is
                                the World Record Edition, which was only used on the first
                                five Veyron Super Sports built. This model boasts a lacquer
                                coating over the Bugatti’s carbon-fiber skin with highlights
                                of bright orange on its front fascia, ground effect, engine
                                viewing area, roof intakes, and the wheels. While we don’t
                                have official confirmation, we are pretty certain that the
                                World Record Edition scheme is completely sold out. If you
                                really want a custom look, you can pay an extra $428,000 and
                                get a 10-percent-clear lacquer coating, leaving the carbon
                                fiber shell exposed for the world to see.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                One thing that people likely don’t realize until seeing and
                                driving the Veyron 16.4 is that it’s a massive automobile.
                                We’re not talking about your sleek Lamborghini Lamborghini s,
                                Ferrari Ferrari s, and Lotus Lotus es; we’re talking about a
                                car that weighs in at about 4,052 lbs – roughly 110 lbs less
                                than the all-aluminum Veyron 16.4 – and measures 175.7 inches
                                long x 78.7 inches wide x 45.6 inches long. Yeah, it’s a big
                                boy, but this extra girth and weight gives this hyper car a
                                very grounded feeling, which we’ll get into in a bit.
